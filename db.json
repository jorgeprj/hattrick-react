Substantial investments were made in infrastructure, facilities, and, crucially, in the player roster. The goal was clear: to elevate the club to higher echelons of English football.",
					"In the following years, Salford City experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of English football divisions. Achieving consecutive titles and promotions, the club swiftly moved from lower levels to non-professional leagues, establishing itself as a formidable opponent.",
					"This remarkable trajectory culminated in a historic milestone in 2019 when Salford City secured promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The team earned this honor by winning the National League play-offs, securing their place in the fourth tier of English football.",
					"This achievement not only marked a moment of triumph for the club but also stood as a testament to the commitment and vision of the \"Class of 92\" in transforming Salford City into a respected force in the English football landscape. The club is now poised to take on new challenges and script the next chapter of its history in the world of football."
